    Because MathML is an entire language in its own right, we just don't have the scope to go through its general aspects.
    Some great general resources are available on the :mathml2help:`MathML 2.0 site <>`, and we'll discuss below the more CellML specific restrictions in the other "See more" sections.

    **Please note** that MathML2 content markup is the only syntax used in CellML, even though more recent versions (MathML3 and MathML4) are available.
