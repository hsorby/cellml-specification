    All this means is that mapped/connected :code:`variables` (ie: those specified by :code:`connection` and :code:`map_variables` items) must be in different :code:`components`.
    Since the only reason you'd need to use these connections is in order to access a :code:`variable` in another :code:`component`, this restriction does kinda make sense!

        <model>
            <component name="happily_ever_after">
                <variable name="juliet" interface_type="public">
                <variable name="romeo" interface_type="public">
            </component>

            <!-- This is a not valid because component_1 and component_2 are the same -->
            <connection component_1="happily_ever_after" component_2="happily_ever_after">
                <map_variables variable_1="romeo" variable_2="juliet">
            </connection>
