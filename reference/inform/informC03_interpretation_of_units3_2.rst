    As discussed in the previous "See more" block, "irreducible" or "base" units are those fundamental quantities which cannot be expressed in any other way.
    This includes user-defined base units too.

    The "unit reduction" of any :code:`units` item is simply a recipe for how any units are constructed, from these "base unit" ingredients.


    For example, the units "metres per second" could be written :math:`m/s` or :code:`product[ (metre)^1 , (second)^-1 ]`, or :code:`product[ power(metre, 1) , power(second, -2) ]`.
    This final list of tuples, representing the base unit and its exponent, is referred to as the unit reduction tuples for the :code:`units` element.
    Some other examples are given below.

    Related to C03.3.2.1:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- Unit reduction: [ (metre, 1), (second, -1) ] -->
        <units name="metres_per_second">
          <unit units="metre">
          <unit units="second" exponent="-1>
        </units>

    Related to C03.3.2.2: Joules are equivalent to :math:`kg⋅m^2⋅s^{−2}`, and the extra "per second" takes the effective exponent for "second" to -3.

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- Unit reduction: [ (kilogram, 1), (metre, 2), (second, -3) ] -->
        <units name="joules_per_second">
          <unit units="joule" />
          <unit units="second" exponent="-1" />
        </units>

    Related to C03.3.2.3 and 4: The concentration of apples per litre of cider is expressed using the custom base units "apple", the custom derived units "bushell_of_apples" and the built-in convenience units of  "litre", the last being equivalent to cubic metres.
    Note that:

    - scaling does not affect the unit reduction tuples,
    - the custom derived units :code:`bushell_of_apples` does not appear, as it can be further reduced to :code:`apple`,
    - the final exponent of the :code:`metre` base unit comes from applying 3.3.2.4 and multiplying the exponent of the litre reduction tuple (metre, 3) with the exponent given in the :code:`cider_concentration` tuple (litre, -1) to give a (metre, -3) in the final unit reduction tuple set.

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- Unit reduction: [ (apple, 1), (metre, -3) ] -->

        <units name="apple" />

        <units name="bushell_of_apples">
          <unit units="apple" multiplier="1000" />
        </units>

        <units name="cider_concentration">
          <unit units="bushell_of_apples" multiplier="0.5" />
          <unit units="litre" exponent="-1" />
        </units>
