    You may have noticed in the :ref:`Built-in Units<table_built_in_units>` that there is an entry labelled :code:`dimensionless`.

    This is provided for convenience, and doesn't take part in determining the unit reduction for any :code:`units` items.
    Together with the next point, this means that the all unit reduction tuples represent the *minimum possible* description of a :code:`units` item.
    For example, this :code:`units` item has the unit reduction of :code:`(metre, 1)`:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- The "dimensionless" base units do not appear in the unit reduction -->
        <units name="metres_by_dimensionless">
          <unit units="metre">
          <unit units="dimensionless" exponent="3">
        </units>
